Java CMD Boilerplate
====================
This is a simples educational project. The idea is to provide users
with a command-line boilerplate project for managing Java projects.

Features
--------
For the moment, the project just presents a simple structure for
managing source codes, class files (compiling them in a separate
directory, just like IDEs), jar generation and jUnit tests execution.

For more information, try asking the project itself for help
("make help" command).

TODO
====
- There might be some dependency issues while compiling source files.
- Perhaps using a JDBC in the beginning might be a good idea
- Support the generation of war files for web projects.
- JPA jar files and generation of configuration files
